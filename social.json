    "bio": "Hi, I’m Philipp — a self-taught game developer from Germany with a lifelong passion for gaming and creating. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by how games can spark imagination, and that curiosity drove me to teach myself programming so I could bring my own ideas to life.<br><br>Over the years, I’ve explored nearly every corner of game development, from coding and design to art and experimentation with new tools and workflows. Working mostly on solo projects has taught me to be versatile and resourceful, and I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into playable experiences.<br><br>I believe the core of every great game is simple: fun. Graphics, code, and polish all matter, but if players aren’t enjoying themselves, the game isn’t doing its job. That philosophy drives everything I create. I love experimenting with different styles and genres, prototyping wild ideas, and learning what makes games truly enjoyable and memorable.<br><br>I’m also deeply interested in new technologies, especially AI. I see AI not as a replacement for creativity, but as a powerful assistant — a way to expand ideas, avoid tunnel vision, and discover new possibilities. I’m fascinated by the future of AI in games, from smarter systems and procedural worlds to experiences that adapt uniquely to every player. To me, the idea of games generating themselves dynamically at runtime is an exciting glimpse of what’s to come.<br><br>So far, I’ve published projects on itch.io, participated in game jams and university projects, and continue to explore new platforms for releasing my work. Each project teaches me something new, whether it’s tackling a game jam under time pressure, experimenting with AI-assisted tools, or refining my creative process.<br><br>At the end of the day, I’m both a gamer and a creator — someone who loves playing games just as much as making them. My goal is to keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep building experiences that bring people joy.",
